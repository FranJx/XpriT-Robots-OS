# ⚙️ XpriT-Robots-OS

Welcome to **XpriT-Robots-OS**, the official collection of projects by **XpriT Robotics**, an Argentine team passionate about competitive, educational, and industrial robotics.

This repository is an open space where we share **complete robots**, **development boards**, **experimental designs**, and much more, aiming to **promote robotics** and inspire the next generation of innovators.

## 🌟 About Us

We are a group of young people from Misiones, Argentina, who found in robotics a way to learn, compete, teach, and dream. We founded **XpriT Robotics** with the purpose of taking our ideas beyond competitions, and today we’ve decided to open our designs to the world.

> “We dream of a future where every young person has access to build, make mistakes, gain experience... and share it.”

**Founder:** Franco Joaquín Aguirre Elizalde (Fran)  
🛠️ Self-taught | 🤖 WRO Champion | 🚀 Tech advocate

## 🤖 Featured Projects



### 🐍 **Kōryū** — The Dragon of Wisdom
> This robot was developed to meet every need a minisumo might have. It's both fast and powerful, offering a perfect balance between speed and strength. Kōryū features an interactive OLED interface and multiple operating modes, including both Autonomous and RC (Remote Control) functionality.  
> In this project you'll find:
> - STL and SLDPRT of the chassis
> - Modular code with multi-mode support
> - Strategy breakdown and competition videos

### ⚡ **Flash-X** — Speed in Robot Form

> Designed to offer **the greatest show for the audience**, Flash-X races across the tatami with overwhelming acceleration. Its lightweight, symmetrical frame allows for fluid frontal attacks and evasive maneuvers.  
> Includes:
> - Aerodynamic 3D chassis  
> - Predictive evasion algorithm  
> - Tournament demonstrations

### 🛡️ **Titan-Core** — The XpriT All-Terrain Base

> Our foundational design for testing, learning, and continuous evolution.  
> Perfect for those who want to understand how a combat robot is built from scratch.  
> Contains:
> - Commented and modular code  
> - Custom PCB  
> - Step-by-step explanation

> ⚙️ More designs will be added: the XpriT collection never stops growing!
